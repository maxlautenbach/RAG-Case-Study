Die Leitveranstaltung, die sogenannte \u201e Investment Round \u201c, dient dazu, Finanzmittel f\u00fcr die  World Health Organization  (WHO) zu mobilisieren. Es geht dabei um das 14. Allgemeine Arbeitsprogramm der  WHO  f\u00fcr den Zeitraum 2025 bis 2028. Das Wichtigste in K\u00fcrze: Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz k\u00fcndigte einen deutschen Finanzbeitrag von mindestens 360 Millionen Euro f\u00fcr das Arbeitsprogramm der  WHO  2025 bis 2028 an.\u00a0Die  WHO  brauche eine nachhaltige Finanzierung, um planen und flexibel reagieren zu k\u00f6nnen. Es sei wichtig, die finanzielle Verantwortung auf mehr Schultern zu verteilen. Der Bundeskanzler wies in seiner Rede darauf hin, dass mit dem Geld f\u00fcr die  WHO  vielen Frauen und M\u00e4nnern \u2013 und vor allem Kindern \u2013 ein ges\u00fcnderes Leben erm\u00f6glicht werden k\u00f6nne. Er erinnerte an die wichtige Rolle, die die  WHO  k\u00fcrzlich beim Ausbruch des  Mpox -Virus in Zentralafrika gespielt hatte.\u00a0 Die Covid-Pandemie habe gezeigt, dass Pandemien nicht an L\u00e4ndergrenzen haltmachten. Daher werde man sich weiterhin daf\u00fcr einsetzen, dass es zum Abschluss eines Internationalen Pandemieabkommens komme.

Saving as many lives as possible is what the World Health Organization aspires to. One number reflects just how lofty this aspiration is: 40\u00a0million lives. That is how many lives the WHO will be able to save over the next four years. Because there are more vaccines that protect against serious diseases. Because there is better access to doctors, nurses, clinics. Because medical staff receive more professional training. Because meaningful data is collected. The World Health Summit each year shows how far we have come\u00a0\u2013 and what must be tackled next. With the money that we collect at this pledging event today, we can enable many women and men\u00a0\u2013 and above all children\u00a0\u2013 to live healthier lives. With less pain, fewer infections, less suffering. Many thanks for coming to Berlin from around the world to be here. I join in bidding you a warm welcome! One very recent example illustrates how important the World Health Organization is. In August, there was an outbreak of mpox in Central Africa. This disease is particularly dangerous for people who cannot access clean water or reliable medical care. Who do not have space to isolate. Who have weak immune systems. The World Health Organization sprang into action following the outbreak and declared it a public health emergency of international concern\u00a0\u2013 the highest level of alarm. This shows how swiftly the organisation can act. After providing initial emergency assistance, the WHO called on the research community to share data and on countries to donate vaccines. I am pleased that the German Government was immediately able to offer 100,000\u00a0doses. Vaccination campaigns are now being organised on the ground and staff are being trained to carry them out. Together with UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, work is being done to ensure that everyone can be safely vaccinated, with clean needles, vaccines kept at the right temperature, tents, qualified staff, a vaccination campaign. The alarm levels help all countries to better assess emergency situations such as the mpox\u00a0outbreak and to make decisions accordingly. In May this year, at the last World Health Assembly, we improved the categorisation of the alarm levels and made specific adjustments to the International Health Regulations. This is particularly important for tackling the most serious diseases there are: Ebola, mpox, the Marburg virus and polio. This enables us to better tailor our response when something happens. We live in a deeply interconnected world. Aeroplanes take off every second, transporting goods and passengers around the globe. Sometimes they also carry viruses on board. The COVID-19 pandemic made it definitively clear that an outbreak of infectious disease anywhere in the world affects us all. Pandemics do not stop at borders. This represents a global challenge, one that we can only properly tackle together. And so we are continuing to campaign for an international pandemic instrument to be concluded\u00a0\u2013 sooner rather than later. An instrument that should improve prevention and preparedness as well as enable us to respond more swiftly to pandemics and cooperate more closely with other states. This is important. The World Health Organization\u2019s work benefits us all. What it needs for this work is sustainable financing that gives it the certainty to plan ahead and the flexibility to react. I am therefore pleased that the member states have decided on a gradual increase of their assessed contributions. These will partially cover the Fourteenth General Programme of Work. We have to find other ways to fund the rest. This includes making good use of synergies with other stakeholders in global health, such as Gavi, CEPI and the Global Fund. Recently, just a handful of countries have provided large amounts of funding. It would be better for us to spread the responsibility across many more shoulders. Every contribution counts\u00a0\u2013 no matter how small. Ladies and gentlemen, That is why we have invited you to this\u00a0pledging event. I am especially pleased to see that both old acquaintances and new donors are prepared to support the World Health Organization. My thanks go to the Wellcome Trust as well as the Gates Foundation for their unwavering efforts. Bill Gates, Your goal und your foundation\u2019s top priority are to eradicate polio. Your decades of tenacious work show how difficult this is. But thanks to everything that you and your fellow campaigners have done over the last years, we are better able to fight many other infectious diseases, too. I would like to take this opportunity to say to you in person, most sincerely: Thank you so much! And I thank all of the states, foundations and business representatives who have made pledges here in Berlin today. Germany, too, supports sustainable financing for the WHO. And so I am pleased to be able to share with you today that Germany will be providing the World Health Organization with a total of at least 360\u00a0million euro for the next General Programme of Work. Together with our French and Norwegian friends, I appeal to you: Join us! Let us support the WHO together! Let us save lives together. Ladies and gentlemen, This pledging event is a great success! We have built trust for a healthier world and we will continue to do so. And so I say to all of you, from the bottom of my heart: Thank you very much.  "}
